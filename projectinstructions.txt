Follow the rules in the project-rules.mdc file.
I want to create a bot that searches the web for jobs for me.
The findings will be stored in a .csv file where the rows will be each job, and the column will be the job title, the job location, the job description, the qualifications, and the salary.
I want to have a separate file for internships for recent master's graduates and for entry level jobs.
The type of job I am looking for is in real-time software engineering.
My qualifications are that I have a Master's of Science in Computer Science.
The jobs have to be in Berkeley, Oakland, San Francisco, or New York. They can also be remote.
