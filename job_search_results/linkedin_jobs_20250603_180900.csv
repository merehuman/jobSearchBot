That‚Äôs where you come in. Since we‚Äôre a startup, you‚Äôll make a big impact on ReadMe - both in the daily responsibilities of your role and beyond.ReadMe helps more than 5,000 leading startups and tech companies build beautiful, personalized, and interactive developer hubs. If you‚Äôve ever visited the developer docs for Apple, Notion, or Nvidia, you‚Äôve used ReadMe! We love what we do because it‚Äôs so much more than just documentation. We‚Äôre providing tools for teams to build a better developer experience and make their products and APIs easier to use.‚úÖ You‚Äôll thrive in this role at ReadMe if‚Ä¶You're fluent in TypeScript and have a deep understanding of cloud computing services, making you a go-to for building and scaling modern systems.When it comes to architecture, your skills are top-notch‚Äîyou're a pro at designing systems that are robust, scalable, maintainable and future-proof.You are able to work cross-functionally with designers and product folks at just the right level‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs big-picture brainstorming or in nitty-gritty details.You thrive on collaboration and know how to create space for everyone‚Äôs voice at the table (or Zoom call).Complex problems don‚Äôt scare you: you‚Äôre a natural at untangling them, finding efficient solutions, and guiding the team toward the finish line‚Äîeven if it means making a compromise or two along the way.You believe in the magic of iteration‚Äîshipping small, learning fast, and improving constantly.You genuinely enjoy mentoring and helping your teammates level up‚Äîit‚Äôs not just about writing code, but building the people around you up too.You're a pro at striking the perfect balance between driving things forward on your own to deliver real value while also breaking down problems into bite-sized pieces that the whole team can tackle together.You're passionate about engineering and always hungry to learn more, with a knack for diving deep to understand the scope of a problem and crafting the right solutions.üíª Types of projects you‚Äôll work onWe‚Äôre all about making life easier for our customers‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs simplifying how they create and maintain their docs or giving them better ways to track API metrics. Solving real problems for our users means we get to tackle some seriously interesting technical challenges. Some examples of projects Back End Engineers have worked on recently include:We built a Git-backed data storage service to scale with our growing customer base, serving thousands of projects seamlessly via Git storage. But it wasn‚Äôt just a cool engineering feat‚Äîit empowers our users to manage their docs directly from their existing Git repositories. People say documentation is where information goes to die, but we‚Äôre on a mission to make ReadMe the place where documentation truly comes to life!Some projects are about looking back so we can build a better future. To keep ReadMe moving forward, we took a hard look at our original API layer and realized it needed a redesign‚Äînot just for our sake, but to make our customers' lives easier too. So, we rolled up our sleeves, reworked our API models, separated our APIs from our data layer, and automated API documentation. It‚Äôs easy for companies to just keep stacking onto what already exists, but at ReadMe, we believe quality improvements matter just as much as new features.üíô You'll love working at ReadMe because‚Ä¶ReadMe is a company that prides itself on caring about it‚Äôs people; customers and employees.

Our teams are full of curious, creative, and committed people who love what they‚Äôre building. If that sounds like you, you‚Äôll be right at home at ReadMe!ü¶â Who We AreWe're a small team of humans (and one owl) working together to do big things, and we‚Äôre growing fast! That‚Äôs where you come in. Since we‚Äôre a startup, you‚Äôll make a big impact on ReadMe - both in the daily responsibilities of your role and beyond.ReadMe helps more than 5,000 leading startups and tech companies build beautiful, personalized, and interactive developer hubs. If you‚Äôve ever visited the developer docs for Apple, Notion, or Nvidia, you‚Äôve used ReadMe! We love what we do because it‚Äôs so much more than just documentation. We‚Äôre providing tools for teams to build a better developer experience and make their products and APIs easier to use.‚úÖ You‚Äôll thrive in this role at ReadMe if‚Ä¶You're fluent in TypeScript and have a deep understanding of cloud computing services, making you a go-to for building and scaling modern systems.When it comes to architecture, your skills are top-notch‚Äîyou're a pro at designing systems that are robust, scalable, maintainable and future-proof.You are able to work cross-functionally with designers and product folks at just the right level‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs big-picture brainstorming or in nitty-gritty details.You thrive on collaboration and know how to create space for everyone‚Äôs voice at the table (or Zoom call).Complex problems don‚Äôt scare you: you‚Äôre a natural at untangling them, finding efficient solutions, and guiding the team toward the finish line‚Äîeven if it means making a compromise or two along the way.You believe in the magic of iteration‚Äîshipping small, learning fast, and improving constantly.You genuinely enjoy mentoring and helping your teammates level up‚Äîit‚Äôs not just about writing code, but building the people around you up too.You're a pro at striking the perfect balance between driving things forward on your own to deliver real value while also breaking down problems into bite-sized pieces that the whole team can tackle together.You're passionate about engineering and always hungry to learn more, with a knack for diving deep to understand the scope of a problem and crafting the right solutions.üíª Types of projects you‚Äôll work onWe‚Äôre all about making life easier for our customers‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs simplifying how they create and maintain their docs or giving them better ways to track API metrics. Solving real problems for our users means we get to tackle some seriously interesting technical challenges. Some examples of projects Back End Engineers have worked on recently include:We built a Git-backed data storage service to scale with our growing customer base, serving thousands of projects seamlessly via Git storage. But it wasn‚Äôt just a cool engineering feat‚Äîit empowers our users to manage their docs directly from their existing Git repositories. People say documentation is where information goes to die, but we‚Äôre on a mission to make ReadMe the place where documentation truly comes to life!Some projects are about looking back so we can build a better future. To keep ReadMe moving forward, we took a hard look at our original API layer and realized it needed a redesign‚Äînot just for our sake, but to make our customers' lives easier too. So, we rolled up our sleeves, reworked our API models, separated our APIs from our data layer, and automated API documentation. It‚Äôs easy for companies to just keep stacking onto what already exists, but at ReadMe, we believe quality improvements matter just as much as new features.üíô You'll love working at ReadMe because‚Ä¶ReadMe is a company that prides itself on caring about it‚Äôs people; customers and employees.

Our teams are full of curious, creative, and committed people who love what they‚Äôre building. If that sounds like you, you‚Äôll be right at home at ReadMe!ü¶â Who We AreWe're a small team of humans (and one owl) working together to do big things, and we‚Äôre growing fast! That‚Äôs where you come in. Since we‚Äôre a startup, you‚Äôll make a big impact on ReadMe - both in the daily responsibilities of your role and beyond.ReadMe helps more than 5,000 leading startups and tech companies build beautiful, personalized, and interactive developer hubs. If you‚Äôve ever visited the developer docs for Apple, Notion, or Nvidia, you‚Äôve used ReadMe! We love what we do because it‚Äôs so much more than just documentation. We‚Äôre providing tools for teams to build a better developer experience and make their products and APIs easier to use.‚úÖ You‚Äôll thrive in this role at ReadMe if‚Ä¶You're fluent in TypeScript and have a deep understanding of cloud computing services, making you a go-to for building and scaling modern systems.When it comes to architecture, your skills are top-notch‚Äîyou're a pro at designing systems that are robust, scalable, maintainable and future-proof.You are able to work cross-functionally with designers and product folks at just the right level‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs big-picture brainstorming or in nitty-gritty details.You thrive on collaboration and know how to create space for everyone‚Äôs voice at the table (or Zoom call).Complex problems don‚Äôt scare you: you‚Äôre a natural at untangling them, finding efficient solutions, and guiding the team toward the finish line‚Äîeven if it means making a compromise or two along the way.You believe in the magic of iteration‚Äîshipping small, learning fast, and improving constantly.You genuinely enjoy mentoring and helping your teammates level up‚Äîit‚Äôs not just about writing code, but building the people around you up too.You're a pro at striking the perfect balance between driving things forward on your own to deliver real value while also breaking down problems into bite-sized pieces that the whole team can tackle together.You're passionate about engineering and always hungry to learn more, with a knack for diving deep to understand the scope of a problem and crafting the right solutions.üíª Types of projects you‚Äôll work onWe‚Äôre all about making life easier for our customers‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs simplifying how they create and maintain their docs or giving them better ways to track API metrics. Solving real problems for our users means we get to tackle some seriously interesting technical challenges. Some examples of projects Back End Engineers have worked on recently include:We built a Git-backed data storage service to scale with our growing customer base, serving thousands of projects seamlessly via Git storage. But it wasn‚Äôt just a cool engineering feat‚Äîit empowers our users to manage their docs directly from their existing Git repositories. People say documentation is where information goes to die, but we‚Äôre on a mission to make ReadMe the place where documentation truly comes to life!Some projects are about looking back so we can build a better future. To keep ReadMe moving forward, we took a hard look at our original API layer and realized it needed a redesign‚Äînot just for our sake, but to make our customers' lives easier too. So, we rolled up our sleeves, reworked our API models, separated our APIs from our data layer, and automated API documentation. It‚Äôs easy for companies to just keep stacking onto what already exists, but at ReadMe, we believe quality improvements matter just as much as new features.üíô You'll love working at ReadMe because‚Ä¶ReadMe is a company that prides itself on caring about it‚Äôs people; customers and employees. We don‚Äôt just care about the work we do, but the people who make ReadMe what it is. Take a glance at our benefits and you‚Äôll see that our culture of care is intentionally built into how we operate as a company.üõ£Ô∏è What‚Äôs the hiring process like?At ReadMe, we want the interview process to reflect who we are: open, caring, with just a touch of whimsy. We‚Äôve designed the process not only to embody the values that have helped us build an amazing team but also to give candidates the best opportunity to showcase their skills and let their true selves shine. After all, it‚Äôs about finding the right people to help take ReadMe even further!

These take an average of 4.5 hours including an hour break. We are able to be flexible with the schedule and split it up over two days if that works best for you! We start with a 15-minute get-to-know-you with the people you‚Äôll be interviewing with, and then have you talk with each person one-on-one later on.We‚Äôll let you know how things went within a week!
